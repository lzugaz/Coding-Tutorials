Project: Simple Bank System
Objective: Create a basic bank system that allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. The system should handle user input errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

Requirements:

Variables: Use variables to store user details like account name, balance, etc.
Print Statements: Display messages to the user, e.g., balance, errors, welcome messages.
If Statements: Implement decision-making to check for sufficient funds, validate user input, etc.
Loops: Use loops to create a simple menu that allows users to continue performing actions until they decide to exit.
Classes: Design a class BankAccount that encapsulates the details and operations of a bank account.
Exception Handling: Use try-except blocks to manage exceptions, particularly for input operations.

Moddify Both Main.py and BankAccount.py.  To run tests go to RunTest.py and run the Python script and it will give you
a score.
